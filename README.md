# MyGames
In this project, I am going to implement some common games first in order to get familiar with the whole development procedure without being bothered by anything such as the game rules. The games will be modeled in OOP using C++. Since I am experienced in Objective-C and what I currently have is a MAC, I decide to design GUI using Objective-C++.
